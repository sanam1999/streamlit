# Job Level Prediction App

This project is a **Job Level Prediction Application** built using Python and Streamlit. It predicts a user's job level (Entry, Mid, Senior) based on profile details like University GPA, Field of Study, internships, projects, and certifications. The project demonstrates **data preprocessing, model training, and deployment** in a web application.

## Key Features
- Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.  
- Uses machine learning models to predict job levels.  
- Interactive and user-friendly interface using Streamlit.  
- Deployed as a web app with model serialization for production use.
